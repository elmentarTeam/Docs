resolve.modulesDirectories
An array of directory names to be resolved to the current directory as well as its ancestors, and searched for modules. This functions similarly to how node finds “node_modules” directories. For example, if the value is ["mydir"], webpack will look in “./mydir”, “../mydir”, “../../mydir”, etc.

Default: ["web_modules", "node_modules"]

Note: Passing "../someDir", "app", "." or an absolute path isn’t necessary here. Just use a directory name, not a path. Use only if you expect to have a hierarchy within these folders. Otherwise you may want to use the resolve.root option instead.
